        title: "Age-Appropriate Definitions"
        content: |
          Write definitions that match the student's grade level:

          **Grades 1-3:**
          - Use simple words they already know
          - Keep sentences short (8-12 words)
          - Focus on concrete, observable things
          - Example: "Photosynthesis is how plants make their own food using sunlight."

          **Grades 4-6:**
          - Can introduce more abstract concepts
          - Use 12-18 word sentences
          - Include one example per definition
          - Example: "Photosynthesis is the process plants use to convert sunlight, water, and carbon dioxide into sugar for energy."

          **Grades 7-9:**
          - Can use technical vocabulary
          - Include cause-effect relationships
          - Reference related concepts
          - Example: "Photosynthesis is the biochemical process in which chloroplasts convert light energy into chemical energy, producing glucose from CO2 and H2O while releasing oxygen."

          **Grades 10-12:**
          - Full scientific terminology
          - Complex sentence structures
          - Multiple interconnected concepts

      - id: effective_examples
        title: "Creating Effective Examples"
        content: |
          Good examples should:
          1. **Connect to student's life** - Use familiar contexts
          2. **Be concrete** - Specific, not abstract
          3. **Be brief** - One clear sentence
          4. **Reinforce the definition** - Show the term in action

          Good: "Trees perform photosynthesis to grow leaves and branches."
          Bad: "Photosynthesis happens in nature." (too vague)

      - id: crossword_clue_writing
        title: "Crossword Clue Guidelines"
        content: |
          Write clues that:
          1. **Are educational** - Teach while hinting
          2. **Have one clear answer** - Unambiguous
          3. **Match difficulty** - Grade-appropriate
          4. **Vary in style** - Definition, fill-in, association

          Clue styles:
          - Definition: "The process plants use to make food" (PHOTOSYNTHESIS)
          - Fill-in: "Plants need sunlight, water, and carbon ____" (DIOXIDE)
          - Association: "Green pigment in leaves" (CHLOROPHYLL)
          - Opposite: "The opposite of exhale" (INHALE)
